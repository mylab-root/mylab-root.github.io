<sup>&#8251;</sup> To prepare the 0.5X TAE buffer, make at least 1 L, as each run requires at least 500 mL 0.5X TAE buffer;  

<sup>&dagger;</sup> The big gel slot requires around 40 mL gel solution; the small gel slot requires 20 mL gel solution. For example, to make a 3% big gel, add 1.2 g agarose powder (ultra pure grade) to 40 mL 0.5X TAE buffer.  

<sup>*</sup> To prepare 1000X SYBR stock solution, dilutes 100 &micro;L SYBR<sup>&reg;</sup> raw solution with 900 &micro;L DMSO. This chemical is used to stain the DNA and detected by UV radiation.

# Procedure

## Step 1: Make gel
1. Prepare the gel. After adding agarose powder into the 0.5X TAE buffer, melt them with microwave. Gently shake the vial during each time points.
> - use mid-low firepower, 1 mins &rarr; 30 secs &rarr; add ddH<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; 20 secs &rarr; 10 secs

2. Add 0.001 volume of SYBR&reg; stock solution into the gel solution immediately ( 1000X &rarr; 1X ), gently shake to mix them well;
> - For example, 40 mL gel requires 40 <i>&micro;</i>L 1000X SYBR stock solution.
3. Pour the gel into the gel container and wait for solidification (around 15 mins);

## Step 2: Set up the electrode machine
4. Prepare the electropheresis machine, the electrode direction should be from negative to positive;
5. After the gel was solidified, put the gel container together with the gel into the elctrophoresis machine;
6. Add some TAE buffer (same strength with the gel; 0.5X in this case) into the electropheresis machine 
and make sure the gel was fully submerged in the buffer;

## Step 3: Load sample
7. Add loading dye to the PCR product. The loading dye final concentration should be 1X.
For example, 2 &micro;L 6X loading dye + 10 &micro;L PCR product;
8. Gently inject 2 &micro;L ladder marker into the first and the last wells of the gel;
9. Gently inject the blank and the PCR products ( around 6 &micro;L ) into the wells;

## Step 4: Start running
10. Set the voltage as <b>135 V</b> and the runtime as <b>40 mins</b>;
> 5 ~ 10 V / cm for DNA size < 1 kb;  
> 4 ~ 10 V / cm for DNA size between 1 ~ 12 kb;  
> 1 ~ 3 V / cm for DNA size greater than 12 kb.  
> <i>For our machine, the distance between the electrodes is around 13.5 cm.</i>

## Step 5: Gel-imaging
1. Turn on the machine (Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR+);
2. Put in the gel;
3. Start up the "Image Lab" software;
4. New protocol;
5. Gel imaging;
6. Application &rarr; Select &rarr; Nucleic acid &rarr; SYBR<sup>&reg;</sup> Safe;
7. Position Gel &rarr; Filter 1 &rarr; adjust gel position;
8. Run protocol;
9. Export for publication ( Export for analysis is 16-bit images ).
